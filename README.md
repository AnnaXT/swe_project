Brainstorming:

idea_1:
Map Social, we intend to create a map software that will allow users to interact, make friends, receive tasks and earn income on this software just like the map of the game.

idea_2:
Security software, users can use this software to protect their security at any time, users can turn on the password every 15 minutes to enter to confirm the status of their security. If the user is in danger, the location will be shared to the user's friends and people around them.

idea_3: 
A slack/piazza like website for NYU. Professors and students, when need interns or team members to complete a research/project, can post the information on the website to recruit helpers, and people who are interested can send out their resumes and other materials, and finally the leader of the project can choose the most suited one to help him/her. The project in this case means larger independent projects rather than some small class projects.
