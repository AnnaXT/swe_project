Brainstorming:

idea_1:
Map Social, we intend to create a map software that will allow users to interact, make friends, receive tasks and earn income on this software just like the map of the game.

idea_2:
Security software, users can use this software to protect their security at any time, users can turn on the password every 15 minutes to enter to confirm the status of their security. If the user is in danger, the location will be shared to the user's friends and people around them.
